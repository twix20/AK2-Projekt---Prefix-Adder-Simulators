# AK2-Projekt-Prefix-Adder-Simulators

It's a graphic multithreaded Prefix Adder Simulator that contains two adders:
 - Koggeâ€“Stone
 - Ladner Fischer
 
 I wrote all logic and my colleague made a GUI for it.
 

You can download App.jar to see how it works.
Run it with command:
<code>java -jar .\App.jar ProgramTest.class</code>
